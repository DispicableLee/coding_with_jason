The "hash" in Hash Map is a hash function

f is a function
hash functions are functions that do ...

f(x) = y

{
    "Jason": "Red",
    "Rob": "Green"
}

decimal => binary
5       => 101 = 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0

0         1
[ Jason | Rob   ]
[ Red   | Green ]

Say we are in a town
We want to store the number of people at each age
In 1 array

there are 3 people age 1
0 people at age 2
5 people at age 3
...

Direct Access Table

We have an inherent key, which is the index
And the value is the element at that index

[0,3,0,5, ...]


Store the height of players in the NBA
index: 0, 1... 250
value:[      3, 6, 0, ... ]

index: 0, 1... 250
value:[      , ... ]
Go to the 185th index, update the count



f(key) = key % 10

Let's say we are using the key 185 in our hash table
Hey, I found someone at 185 cm. Please update the count

What if we find someone at 195cm? Is there a problem? 5

Inner Array of the hash table
index  :  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ... 
values : [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, LL...]

(185, 1) -> (195, 1) -> (205, 1) 215, 225, 235, 245

Hey, get me the # of people at 205cm

1. Calculate the value of the hash function with input 205
    - 205 % 10: Constant time
2. the resulting value will be 'where' i.e the space in memory where the associated value is stored



Inside the hash table, if I were to request
the number of people that have been counted
at 185cm, how would it do that?
key = 185




Array/List
============
0   1   2   3
E1, E2, E3, E4
============




Hash Table
============
hash_function: f(x) = x %10

185%10 = the index you would search

0   1   2   3
E1, E2, E3, E4
